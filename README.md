# Railway-ticket-reservation-system
Created a C-based program to manage railway ticket booking, cancellation, and reservation operations. Designed to automate and streamline ticket management, this system required a deep understanding of data structures to efficiently handle customer data and operations.
This simple reservation system allows multiple passengers to book and cancel tickets while keeping track of available seats on each train. The design can be further extended with features like searching for specific trains or adding seat categories.
